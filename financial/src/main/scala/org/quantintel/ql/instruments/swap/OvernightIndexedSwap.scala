/**
 * An interst rate swap involving the overnight rate being exchanged for a fixed
 * interest rate.  An overnight index swap uses an overnight rate index, such as the
 * Fed Funds Rate, as the underlying for its floating leg, while the fixed leg would
 * be set at an assumed rate.  Overnight index swaps are popular amongst finanial
 * institutions for the reason that the overnight index is considered to be a good
 * indicator of the interbank credit markets, and less risky than other traditional
 * interst rate spreads.
