/**
 *
 * An Asian option (also known as an 'average option') is a special type of option contract. For Asian
 * options the payoff is determined by the average underlying price over some pre-set period of time.
 * This is different from the case of the usual European option and American option, where the payoff
 * of the option contract depends on the price of the underlying instrument at time of exercise;  Asian
 * options are thus one of the basic forms of exotic options.
